# Flex02: Responsive Mockup

This mockup is far from finished, and there are several problems. In the class we will optimize the page, and prepare a mockup for several devices.

* Mobile first
* Responsive
* Flexbox layout / grid


## The Mobile First Principle

In this case the responsive design has just started. Of course the starting point is the mobile styles.

Todos:

* Better responsive image sizes (optimize for performance in Photoshop).
* Tablets
* Screen

## The Images

Need some work in the "digital darkroom". Please optimize all your images in Photoshop or GIMP.

## Ico files

Scale your page logo to a 16x16 px .png.
